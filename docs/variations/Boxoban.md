# Variation: Boxoban

| Example Game 1 |
| :---: | 
| ![Game 1](/docs/Animations/solved_3.gif?raw=true) |


## 1. Idea
Instead of generating a new level on every reset operation, a pre-generated level is chosen randomly. When Boxoban is run for the first time the levels are downloaded from DeepMinds [Github repository](https://github.com/deepmind/boxoban-levels) and stored in the folder _.sokoban_cache_. This path can be changed by environment variable `SOKOBAN_CACHE_PATH`

In case you use the Boxoban levels for your research, the authors of the boxoban-levels repository ask you to cite their work as follows:
```
@misc{boxobanlevels,
author = {Arthur Guez, Mehdi Mirza, Karol Gregor, Rishabh Kabra, Sebastien Racaniere, Theophane Weber, David Raposo, Adam Santoro, Laurent Orseau, Tom Eccles, Greg Wayne, David Silver, Timothy Lillicrap, Victor Valdes},
title = {An investigation of Model-free planning: boxoban levels},
howpublished= {https://github.com/deepmind/boxoban-levels/},
year = "2018",
}
```
Depending on your use case, please consider the [licence](https://github.com/deepmind/boxoban-levels/blob/master/LICENSE) of DeepMinds repository.

## 2. Rules
Same rules as the regular Sokoban game.

## 3. Room Configurations
Through the API we provide access to 'unfiltered' and 'medium' levels. The unflitered levels are split into a train, test, and validation set. Whereas the medium levels are only split into train and validation. For more details see DeepMind's [README.md](https://github.com/deepmind/boxoban-levels/blob/master/README.md).
Of course all configurations can be rendered as TinyWorld.
